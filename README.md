# SHIELD: **S**patially-en**H**anced Immun**E** **L**andscape **D**ecoding  
*Weakly supervised graph attention networks for interpretable cell-cell interaction analysis*

**SHIELD** is a framework that leverages *Graph Attention Networks (GATs)* to infer and interpret disease-associated cell-cell interactions from spatial omics data. It highlights which immune interactions are most predictive of disease outcomes, by summarizing attention scores at the cell-phenotype level ‚Äî enabling biologically meaningful insights.

We applied SHIELD to multiplexed tissue imaging data in two key disease contexts:

- **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**: SHIELD identified differential immune interactions between tumor and adjacent healthy tissue, including a subtle but significant interaction between **MAIT cells** and **macrophages**, supporting previous findings on tumor progression.
- **Diabetes**: Using imaging mass cytometry from diabetic pancreas tissue, SHIELD revealed dynamic immune-Œ≤ cell interactions, uncovering stage-specific communication patterns between **helper T cells**, **cytotoxic T cells**, and **Œ≤ cells**.
- 	**Colorectal cancer (CRC)**: SHIELD uncovered a suppressive interaction between **CD8‚Å∫ T cells** and **CD11b‚Å∫CD68‚Å∫ macrophages** enriched in non-responders. This finding refines previous observations of immune-suppressive neighborhood coupling in CRC and highlights a potential mechanism of immunotherapy resistance.

In both cases, SHIELD recovered experimentally validated interactions and demonstrated its strength in extracting interpretable and spatially-aware immune landscape features.

## üß≠ Workflow Overview

SHIELD is built to process immune spatial data in a reproducible and modular way. Example inputs are provided in the example/ folder, including dictionary-based data specs that describe paths, phenotypes, and output locations.

‚∏ª

## üìÇ Data Preparation

To construct spatial graphs from your input data:
   ```
   python create_graphs.py
   ```

## üß™ Model Training

To perform a hyperparameter search:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```

‚Ä¢	Runs a search using your specified config.
‚Ä¢	Saves training and validation metrics in CSV format for all models.

To analyze the hyperparameter search and retrain the best model:
   ```
   python evaluate_hyperearch.py
   ```

‚Ä¢	Generates plots to evaluate the search results.

‚Ä¢	Saves the best configuration as best_config_dict.

‚Ä¢	Retrains the best model on the full training set.

‚Ä¢	Saves final train/test performance.


## üîç Interaction Scoring

To calculate cell-to-cell interaction scores using the trained model:
   ```
   python create_attention_score_interaction.py
   ```

‚Ä¢	Loads the trained model.

‚Ä¢	Computes phenotype-to-phenotype attention scores.

‚Ä¢	Saves both plots and raw scores for downstream interpretation.

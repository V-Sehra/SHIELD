description = "SHIELD is a single-layer Graph Attention Network for systematic and interpretable inference of disease-associated cell-cell interactions from multiplexed tissue imaging data.Designed for weakly supervised classification tasks, SHIELD quantifies interaction relevance via attention scoresenabling post hoc biologically meaningful interpretation without predefined cell-type assumptions. Validated in HCC and T1D datasets, it offers robust, scalable insights into immune spatial dynamics."
